Cloud Trace Service
===================

Cloud Trace Service (CTS) provides operation records for cloud service resources. The operation records include resource operation requests initiated from the public cloud management console or open APIs and responses to the requests. You can query, audit, and backtrack the operation records. In addition, you can use the Object Storage Service (OBS) to synchronize operation records to the OBS buckets.
