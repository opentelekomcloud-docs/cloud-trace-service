Billing
=======

You can use the basic functions of CTS for free, including enabling a tracker, tracking traces, as well as storing and querying traces of the last seven days. In addition, CTS works with other services to provide you with value-added functions such as trace file transfer and encryption.

Value-added functions:

-  Trace transfer: OBS is required. Trace files configured for the management tracker are permanently stored.
-  Trace analysis: This function is provided by CTS and is free to use. However, it depends on log storage of Log Tank Service (LTS), which may generate fees.
