Key Operations on DC
====================

Direct Connect (DC) allows you to establish a private, dedicated network connection from your data center, office, or collocation environment to the cloud platform. It reduces your network latency and provides a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

With CTS, you can record operations associated with DC for later query, audit, and backtracking.
