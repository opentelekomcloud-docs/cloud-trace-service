Enabling Verification of Trace File Integrity
=============================================

Scenarios
---------

During a security investigation, operational records will not be able to serve as effective and authentic evidence if they are deleted or tampered with. You can enable the integrity verification on CTS to ensure the authenticity of trace files. CTS supports integrity verification of trace files for trackers configured with OBS transfer.
