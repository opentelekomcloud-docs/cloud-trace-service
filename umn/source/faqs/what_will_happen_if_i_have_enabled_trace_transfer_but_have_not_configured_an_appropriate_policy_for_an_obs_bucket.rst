What Will Happen If I Have Enabled Trace Transfer But Have Not Configured an Appropriate Policy for an OBS Bucket?
==================================================================================================================

CTS delivers trace files based on the OBS bucket policy. If the policy is configured incorrectly, trace files cannot be delivered.

If an OBS bucket has been deleted or encounters an exception, an error message will be displayed on the management console. In this case, create an OBS bucket or reconfigure access control of the OBS bucket.
