What Services Are Supported for Key Event Notification?
=======================================================

Currently, CTS only sends notifications for some key operations on ECS, EVS, VPC, KMS, IAM, and native OpenStack. This feature currently supports creation, deletion, login, and native OpenStack API operations. This function is still being improved and will support more services and operation types in the future. For details, see :ref:`Configuring a Tracker <en-us_topic_0059288681>`.
