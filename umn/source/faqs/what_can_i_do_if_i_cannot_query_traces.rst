What Can I Do If I Cannot Query Traces?
=======================================

Background
----------

Traces cannot be queried on the CTS console.

Solution
--------

#. Check whether you have configured a proper query time range.
#. Check whether you have configured filters correctly.
#. If you still cannot query traces after the preceding steps, submit a service ticket for technical support.
