How Will CTS Be Affected If My Account Is in Arrears?
=====================================================

If your account is in arrears, CTS can still receive operation records from supported services, but the records can only be retained for 7 days. In most cases, records can be merged into trace files and transferred to OBS buckets for long term storage. Trace file storage in OBS buckets generates fees and this function cannot work when your account is in arrears.

In addition, the only action you can perform on trackers is to delete them.
