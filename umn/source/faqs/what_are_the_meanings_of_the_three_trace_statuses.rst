What Are the Meanings of the Three Trace Statuses?
==================================================

The trace status is defined based on **trace_status** information recorded in a trace. Different fields have different meanings as follows:

-  **normal**: indicates that this operation succeeded.
-  **warning**: indicates that this operation failed.
-  **incident**: indicates that this operation causes a more serious consequence than a failure, for example, causing a node failure or service interruption.
