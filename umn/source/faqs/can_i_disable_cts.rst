Can I Disable CTS?
==================

You can use the basic functions of CTS for free, including enabling a tracker, tracking traces, as well as storing and querying traces of the last seven days. Only value-added services, such as trace transfer, are charged. If you only use the basic services, you do not need to disable CTS since no fees are generated.

If you do need to disable CTS, you can do it in the following two ways:

-  Delete or disable existing trackers. (The **system** tracker created by CTS can only be disabled and cannot be deleted.) No traces will be generated.

-  Delete the CTS agency from the IAM agency list. CTS will become unavailable.
