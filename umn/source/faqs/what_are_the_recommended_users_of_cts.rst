What Are the Recommended Users of CTS?
======================================

It is highly recommended that cloud users should enable CTS.

-  CTS is core to information security audit. It is an essential part of security risk control for information systems in enterprises and public sectors, and is also necessary for compliance with many industry standards and audit specifications.
-  CTS helps accelerate troubleshooting and reduces workforce costs when exceptions occur on cloud resources. With CTS, you can track all operations involved when a fault happens, which helps narrow the possibilities.
