Supported Services
==================

Once you enable CTS, the system automatically identifies cloud services enabled on the cloud platform, captures key operations on the services, and reports audit logs of these operations to CTS.

Key operations triggered by calling IaaS OpenStack APIs are shown in :ref:`Relationship Between Operations Triggered by IaaS OpenStack and Native OpenStack APIs <en-us_topic_0100366885>`.

For details on key operations supported by CTS, see :ref:`Supported Services and Operation Lists <en-us_topic_0100236045>`.
