Trace File
==========

A trace file is a collection of traces and is in JSON format. CTS generates trace files based on services and transfer periods. Then the trace files are transferred to specified OBS buckets.

Generally, all traces generated by a service during a transfer period are compressed into a trace file. However, if there are a large number of traces, the system will adjust the number of traces contained in each trace file as needed.

Trace files can be obtained only from OBS. For details about how to obtain, see :ref:`Querying Archived Traces <en-us_topic_0030598636>`. For details about key fields in traces, see :ref:`Trace Structure <en-us_topic_0030598500>`.
